    Travelling is highly rewarding. It allows us to broaden our horizon in many regards. We can see beyond our doorstep, explore the beauty of planet Earth and experience a variety of cultures and people we could not meet in our usual daily life.
    While these encounters and experiences can seem daunting at first, I encourage everyone to dare, you won't be disappointed.

    text: "It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to."

    I have to say, I was fortunate to grow up with parents fond of travelling themselves and who took me and my brothers along many fantastic journeys. However, the most influence experiences for me were my trips to Japan in 2017 and 2019 when I travelled just with friends to Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Hiroshima. Planning and dealing with everything that comes with such a journey gave me an entirely new appreciation for travelling.
    Above are some impressions of travel experiences I had in the past years.
