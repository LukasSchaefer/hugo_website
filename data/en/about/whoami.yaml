summary: |
    I am a $AGE$-year-old German Data Science and Artificial Intelligence PhD student at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).

    After graduating from [Saarland University](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/) in August 2018 with my Bachelor's degree in computer science, I moved to the beautiful city of Edinburgh, Scotland, to continue my studies as an Informatics postgraduate student. Following my graduation with Distinction and my M.Sc. in Edinburgh, I started a PhD to research novel exploration and generalisation techniques for multi-agent reinforcement learning as part of the [Autonomous Agents Research Group](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/).
