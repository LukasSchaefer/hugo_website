intro: |
    I read (almost) everyday for many years alrady. And if I say almost, I refer to the few exceptions in the year I can count on the fingers of one hand. It became a habit that I read just before sleeping, so that now I even have trouble falling asleep if I don't. In this regard, reading became part of my daily routine. However, it is much more than just a habit. Reading allows me to experience fantastic worlds, heartbreaking stories and learn anything imaginable. It can be inspiring, touching and exciting while all of it is taking place in our imagination.
    
    For many years, I read almost exclusively fantasy novels. From Harry Potter, which I still cherish to this day, over Eragon, the Dwarves and many more to Lord of the Rings. I just could not get enough of stories about magic, dragons, elves and all these fantastic creatures I would only ever be able to meet in my imagination. However, after quite a few years of exclusively reading fantasy I started to become bored of it.

    After a while, I dared to read something entirely different and rediscovered my passion for reading by reading historic novels of Ken Follett, motivated by my father who shares my passion for history. From there I started reading a larger variety of books from science-fiction thrillers like The Swarm of Frank Sch√§tzing, the biography of Steve Jobs to Life Without Limits. In this truly inspiring and touching book, which I can not recommend enough, Nick Vujicic shares his story of becoming a motivational speaker being born without any limbs.

    Besides the impressions one can get from reading, it can also help to improve language skills. I surely became more proficient in English from reading many novels in this language.
    I would highly encourage everyone to read frequently. No matter your interests, there will be books matching your preferences and it is rewarding, beneficial and fun at the same time.
