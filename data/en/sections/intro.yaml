summary: |
    I am a 25-year-old Data Science and Artificial Intelligence PhD student from Germany working on Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning at the University of Edinburgh, where I am supervised by [Stefano Albrecht](http://svalbrecht.de/) and [Amos Storkey](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/).

    Currently, I am doing a research internship at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab (multi-agent team) with David Mguni. Previously, I interned at Dematic where I researched and developed AI solutions for large-scale warehouse automation.

    My research focuses on the challenges of generalisation and sample efficiency: how can multiple agents learn effective behaviour with less data and be able to learn robust, re-usable skills which transfer to new environments.
