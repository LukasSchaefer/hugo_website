summary: |
    I am a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence PhD student from Germany working on multi-agent reinforcement learning at the University of Edinburgh, where I am supervised by [Stefano Albrecht](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/stefano-albrecht/) and [Amos Storkey](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/).

    Stefano, [Filippos Christianos](https://fchristianos.com/) and myself together wrote a textbook on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. The book will be published with MIT Press and a PDF is already available at [www.marl-book.com](https://www.marl-book.com/)!

    My research focuses on the challenges of generalisation and sample efficiency: how can multiple agents learn effective behaviour with less data and be able to learn robust, re-usable skills which transfer to new environments.

    Previously, I interned at at Microsoft Research Cambridge, where I worked with the [Game Intelligence lab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-reinforcement-learning/) under the supervision of Sam Devlin, at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab and Dematic. At MSR, I researched visual encoders for imitation learning in video games, including vision foundation models. At Huawei, I was part of the multi-agent team researching novel exploration techniques for multi-agent reinforcement learning under the supervision of David Mguni. At Dematic, I researched and developed AI solutions for large-scale warehouse automation.
