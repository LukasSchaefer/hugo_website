    **I'll be on the job market for post-doc and research scientist positions in summer/ fall 2024. Please reach out if you think I am a good fit / know of opportunities!**

    I am a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence PhD student from Germany working on multi-agent reinforcement learning at the University of Edinburgh, where I am supervised by [Stefano Albrecht](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/stefano-albrecht/) and [Amos Storkey](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/).

    Stefano, [Filippos](https://fchristianos.com/) and myself wrote a textbook on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The book will be published with MIT Press and is already available at [www.marl-book.com](https://www.marl-book.com/)!

    Reinforcement learning is often sample inefficient, and prone to overfitting, leading to behaviour which often does not generalise across tasks. These challenges are further exacerbated in multi-agent systems in which multiple agents interact with each other in a shared environment. Guided by these challenges of efficiency and generalisation, my PhD research focuses on efficient and generalisable reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems.

    Previously, I interned at at Microsoft Research Cambridge, where I worked with the [Game Intelligence lab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-reinforcement-learning/) under the supervision of Sam Devlin, at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab and Dematic. At MSR, I researched visual encoders for imitation learning in video games, including vision foundation models. At Huawei, I was part of the multi-agent team researching novel exploration techniques for multi-agent reinforcement learning under the supervision of David Mguni. At Dematic, I researched and developed AI solutions for large-scale warehouse automation.
