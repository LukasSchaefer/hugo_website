summary: |

    I am a AI researcher at Microsoft Research with the goal of creating autonomous agents that can efficiently learn to solve complex decision-making tasks in the real world. As part of the [Game Intelligence team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/game-intelligence/), I am working towards autonomous agents that can enable novel experiences and tools in video games. I am broadly excited about technology and AI but most interested in its application for decision-making problems.

    Prior to joining Microsoft Research, I received my PhD and MSc from the University of Edinburgh where I was supervised by [Stefano Albrecht](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/stefano-albrecht/) and [Amos Storkey](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/). My research focused on reinforcement learning, in particular in the context of multi-agent systems that require multiple agents to cooperate with each other.

    The introductory textbook on multi-agent reinforcement learning by Stefano, [Filippos](https://fchristianos.com/), and myself is coming out soon! You can pre-order a print copy of the book to receive it on December 17th [here](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049375/multi-agent-reinforcement-learning/) and find the PDF for free at [www.marl-book.com](https://www.marl-book.com/)!

# Previously, I interned at at Microsoft Research Cambridge, where I worked with the [Game Intelligence lab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-reinforcement-learning/) under the supervision of Sam Devlin, at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab and Dematic. At MSR, I researched visual encoders for imitation learning in video games, including vision foundation models. At Huawei, I was part of the multi-agent team researching novel exploration techniques for multi-agent reinforcement learning under the supervision of David Mguni. At Dematic, I researched and developed AI solutions for large-scale warehouse automation.
