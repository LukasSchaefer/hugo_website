- name: Curiosity in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
  # logo: /images/sections/projects/kubernetes.png
  role: MSc Thesis
  timeline: "May 2019 - Aug 2019"
  # repo: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes # If your project is a public repo on GitHub, then provide this link. it will show star count.
  url: ""  # If your project is not a public repo but it has a website or any external details url then provide it here. don't provide "repo" and "url" simultaneously.
  summary: In my MSc thesis project I researched the application of curiosity-inspired intrinsic exploration bonuses for multi-agent reinforcement learning. Count- and prediction-based curiosities were evaluated in combination with value-based and policy-gradient MARL methods, all implemented in PyTorch.

  url: ""  # If your project is not a public repo but it has a website or any external details url then provide it here. don't provide "repo" and "url" simultaneously.
  summary: Software project as part of Reinforcement Learning lecture developing several classical and deep RL algorithms. Implemented algorithms include dynamic programming algorithms value iteration and policy iteration and tabular RL SARSA, Q-Learning, and Monte Carlo control. Lastly, deep RL methods of asynchronous DQN and tabular multi-agent RL algorithms were implemented and evaluated in the Half field offense (HFO) 2D football environment.

  summary: Group project as part of Robotics Science and Systems lecture with design, construction of a four-wheel differential steering mobile robot and development of an autonomous localisation system based on particle-filtering using sonar and IR sensors. The robot was constructed using a LEGO framework, a Raspberry Pi computer, sensors and actuators. The robot was tasked to navigate through a pre-defined environment without contact to obstacles and act on detection of variable points of interest using light sensors before returning back to its deployment location.

  summary: In this extensive summer group project, we implemented an entire fictional turn-based strategy game in which various different computer- and player-controller characters can move on a hexagonal-map and attack other characters. The entire game-logic, game-server connection and a GUI for players were implemented throughout all stages of software engineering including architecture, creating multiple prototype visualizations and diagrams, implementing and testing our software.
